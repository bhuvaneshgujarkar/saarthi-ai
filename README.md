<h3 align="center">An AI-Powered Dropout Prediction and Counseling System</h3>

---

**SaarthiAI** is a web-based platform designed to address the critical issue of student dropouts in educational institutions. Leveraging predictive analytics, the system identifies students who are at-risk of dropping out by analyzing various factors such as academic performance, attendance, and engagement.

This prototype, developed for the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)**, provides a comprehensive suite for mentors and counselors to monitor student progress, visualize risk trends, and engage with students through an integrated AI chatbot. The goal is to enable timely and effective intervention, providing students with the support they need to succeed.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Role-Based Access:** Separate, tailored user flows for Mentors/Counselors and Students.
* **Mentor Dashboard:** An overview of key metrics, including total students, at-risk students, and counseling sessions.
* **Student Risk Analysis:** A detailed list of students with color-coded risk levels (High, Medium, Low).
* **Prediction Page:** Visualize dropout risk distribution and key influencing factors through dynamic graphs.
* **Interactive AI Chatbot:** A conversational AI for students to seek guidance and support.
* **Modern UI:** A clean, responsive, and dark-mode interface built with Tailwind CSS.
